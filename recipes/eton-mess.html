    <h2>What is an Eton Mess?</h2>
    <p>... what is it? Literally a pile of smashed meringues, whipped cream, and strawberries. You can't mess it up ...
        it's <em>supposed to be a mess</em>.</p>
    <p>Speaking of which: Where does the name “Eton Mess” come from? It is thought to have originated from Eton College,
        the British boarding school for boys. It was served up starting around the 1930s and has become a school
        tradition, and British tradition, ever since. Oh, and the “mess” part is because, no matter how hard you try,
        it's just a soft jumbled amorphous mess.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        serves 4-6

        <h3>for meringues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 egg whites</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp diced freeze-dried strawberries</li>
            <li>2-3 drops red/pink food coloring</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>for strawberry filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb fresh strawberries, washed and hulled</li>
            <li>1 tbsp powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>for whipped cream</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 tbsp powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the meringues.</strong> Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment
                paper. In a mixer
                fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites at medium-high speed until foamy and just beginning to
                form stiff peaks. Continue beating at medium-high, adding the sugar in by the tablespoon, until the
                mixture
                turns thick, white, glossy and holds a stiff peak. Go slowly—this should take 5-10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Divide the whipped egg whites in half. Into one half, fold the diced freeze-dried strawberries. Into the
                other half, add 2-3 drops of red or pink food coloring and gently fold until combined. Spoon the two
                mixtures into a piping bag fitted with a medium star tip (see note). On the prepared sheets, pipe out
                small
                roughly 3/4-inch stars. Bake the meringues at 250 degrees for 25-30 minutes, until they are hard, dry
                and
                easily lift off the parchment paper. Let cool completely (if you can spare the time, it’s better to turn
                off
                the oven, crack the door open and let the meringues cool slowly…but it’s fine to speed it up and place
                them
                on the counter!). Once cool, store in an airtight container until ready for assembly. </li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the strawberries.</strong> Use a small pairing knife to quarter half of the
                strawberries.
                Place the other
                half of the strawberries in a food processor or blender (I used my immersion blender) along with the
                sugar
                and puree into a smooth mixture. Fold the quartered strawberries into the puree. Store in fridge until
                ready
                for assembly.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Eton Mess.</strong> When you are ready to serve, beat the remaining sugar and heavy
                whipping cream until
                stiff. Into pretty bowls or cups, layer in the meringues (crushing them slightly), strawberries and
                whipped
                cream. Enjoy immediately!</li>
        </ol>
