    <h2>What is a Marmalade Meringue Tart?</h2>
    <p>A very easy tart recipe made with homemade preserves and meringue.</p>
    <p>Once the tart base is baked and cut into springlike petals, I simply dolloped in a few teaspoons of the runny
        marmalade and piped over some Italian meringue. A little blowtorching set these little afternoon treats off
        beautifully.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    makes 12

    <ul>
        <li>200g of plain flour</li>
        <li>100g of unsalted butter, cold</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of icing sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>marmalade, homemade or storebought</li>
        <li>55g of egg white, from about 1 1/2 large eggs</li>
        <li>110g of caster sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the pastry by whizzing up the flour, butter and icing sugar in a food processor til you get
            breadcrumbs. To prevent the pastry from getting too tough and overworked I do short blitzes vs a long whirl.
        </li>
        <li>Beat the egg with 1-2 tbsp of water and then add slowly to make a soft dough. Again I do this in the
            processor in short bursts til a ball comes together. Leave the pastry to rest in the fridge for at least 30
            minutes.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 200Â°C/gas mark 6 and grease the tart trays. If using a
            flower cutter you will need to space them out to about 6 per tray.</li>
        <li>Roll the pastry out to a few millimetres thick and then cut out 12 pieces. You will have pastry leftover so
            I tend to sprinkle this with grated Parmesan and bake for about 10 minutes as a cook's treat!.</li>
    </ol>
