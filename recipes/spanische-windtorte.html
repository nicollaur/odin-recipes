    <h2>What is a Spanische Windtorte?</h2>
    <p>A Spanische Windtorte is a meringue gateau or cake, filled with cream and soft fruit with chocolate added
        sometimes.</p>
    <p>So, where does this cake originate from? It is a famous Austrian dessert, albeit one I had never heard of before,
        and is very popular in all the Austrian Coffee and Cake houses. It is known as “the fanciest cake in Vienna” and
        was the dessert cake of choice during the Baroque period of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with the Spanish
        reference being attributed to the Austrian House of Habsburg and their obsession with all things Spanish as the
        time.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    serves 4-6

    <h3>meringue</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large egg whites</li>
        <li>350g caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp cream of tartar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>450ml of whipping cream</li>
        <li>4 tbsp of icing sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of cognac, brandy or liqueur of choice</li>
        <li>500g of mixed berries, or soft fruit</li>
        <li>25g of chocolate, shaved or grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 140°C/gas mark 1 and line two baking sheets with baking paper. Draw around a 19cm/7” round
            cake tin on to the baking paper to make four circles.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg whites, sugar and cream of tartar together in a large clean bowl or in a food mixer until they
            hold firm peaks.</li>
        <li>Spoon or pipe the meringue onto the marked baking paper to make four discs of meringue.</li>
        <li>Bake them in the oven for 1 hour, turning the heat off after the hour and allowing them to continue to dry
            out in the oven for half an hour or overnight.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to assemble the Spanische Windtorte, place the bottom meringue layer onto a serving
            plate, and whip the cream with the icing sugar and cognac until it is stiff enough to spread.</li>
        <li>Divide the cream between the layers, adding fruit as you go, making sure you have some cream and fruit left
            for the topping.</li>
        <li>Finish off with a final layer of cream and fruit and then scatter the chocolate shavings over the top. Slice
            into wedges to serve (suitable for short-term freezing).</li>
    </ol>
